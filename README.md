Archintosh

Archintosh is a fully installed and ready version of ArchLinux, set up to run on the MacBook Air 2013, 13in. screen, 4gb RAM, 1.3GHz dual-core i5, 1400x900 screen-res, etc.
It is made to run alongside a fresh install of OSX Yosemite, to facilitate the delusion of school technical "professionals".
It is used to escape the eternal botnet imposed on us by the school system.
It is installed on a partition which is hidden to OSX and is only bootable by holding the option key.

A simple, but complete installation guide, and eventually cli installer, and maybe even a gui installer, will be added soon.

Also note that this project hasn't been uploaded or even necessarily started yet, and most likely won't be until August, 2015.

Expected release of the first betas and testing versions is expected ca. October, 2015

Similar projects for other linux distros will follow.
The project will be passed on to the next generation of SHS students over the time between May, 2017 and May, 2020.

This line is added as a test to see if my shit worked
